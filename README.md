An esoteric programming language based around recursion. 
See https://esolangs.org/wiki/A_returns_a for more details.

To use the interpreter, run interpreter.py through the command line with the directory for your program as the first argument. 
I've tried to detect most syntax and runtime errors, though I might have missed something. Apologies if it spits out a huge stack trace.
